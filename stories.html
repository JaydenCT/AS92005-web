          <p>I am a Photgrapher located in Berlin, Germany. I enjoy photograpy! I have dedictaed my whole life to photography. My favourite things to do is take pictures of are animals! My most popular photo I have taken is "Cow on Other Hill". I have always had a dream to go on a holiday to Hollywood. I grew up poor and never had enough money to travel. Photgraphy has helped me, and I can now go on my Hollywood holiday!<h5>

            <h5>I could remember when I was just a little boy and always had loved taking my mother's camera to take pictures of literlly everthing! I have been taking pictures ever since then, which was when I was 4 years old. My favourite pictures that I have taken are 'Creepy House' and 'Spooky Dog'. I have a pet dog named 'Squishy'. As cute as the name is, he's the total opposite. He's a little devil. I have my own instagram for fun (nothing proffesinal) and  mostly take pictues of my dog. I'm planning to start up my won photography group where I can teach people the basics of photography and have also make some new friends.<h5>
